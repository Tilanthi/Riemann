# TRAP REGISTER #1–#54 (Mac, machine 1) — full transcription from the on-disk record

**Provenance (per TRAPS #33/#36, our own rules): every entry below is transcribed from an
on-disk source, cited inline — none reconstructed from memory.** Sources: `CROSS_FERTILISATION_
REPORT.md` §8 (compressed catalogue #1–#32), `NOTES.md` (registrations #15, #30, #33–#38,
#44–#51 at the cited lines), `REPLY_TO_BEAST_3.md` §6 (canonical #39–#43 register).

**Numbering-scheme note (flagged per our Annex B):** traps #1–#14 originated in the cycle-era
record under a separate lettered/parenthesized scheme ((a) VERTEX, (e) FIRST-STEP HOP, …);
the #N registry consolidated them. **#30–(32) are renumbered duplicates of #16–#18** — kept
for citation stability, never cited as distinct. The register is live: tonight's session added
#52–#54 (§5 below).

## §1. #1–#32 — verbatim from `CROSS_FERTILISATION_REPORT.md` §8 ("INSTRUMENT-TRAP CATALOGUE (compressed, #1–#32)")

Mathematics/instrument:

1. Gauss–Hermite node scaling e^{−t∂²} vs e^{−2t∂²} — pin against z²+a² every time.
2. ξ spectral rep = Riemann memoir cosine form (u^{−1/4}; G = d/du[u^{3/2}ψ′]), not u^{s−1} or e^{−πn²u²}.
3. ABSOLUTE Newton tolerance (1e−10) silently kills zero-tracking on small-|f| worlds — normalize per-world.
4. float64 moment-tail Σn^m S_m/m! overflows (n⁹⁰ → inf×0 = nan).
5. Simpson weights inside a convolution = spurious 2h-periodic anti-diagonal error (z=17 off 5e3×) — trapezoid.
6. skipping the d=0 diagonal in correlation kernels = constant bias invisible on regular values, fatal on near-zeros.
7. argument principle on TALL boxes undercounts (vertical-edge phase steps > π on wall shelves).
8. ζ on the real axis returns mpc — compare .real.
9. census "double" zeros = refine-adjacency dedup artifacts.
10. transposed census boxes (x=height, y=across-line) — twice.
11. FIRST-STEP HOP: coarse first march step hops a zero.
12. VERTEX TRAP: t-grid vertices alias double zeros.
13. TRACKER STALL at symmetric births.
14. Hermite quadrature + mpf sorting mixed-type crashes.
15. unary minus on strings in starts lists (heat28b crash). [Full prose: NOTES.md:397]
16. judge an O(a²) residue against BOTH pencil members (heat27).
17. constructed families outside proved classes = census fact only, never theorem.
18. PRE-REGISTER predictions before launching — falsifications are only catchable if written down first.
19. run the elementary-factorization check BEFORE the heavy theorem route (cousin λ<½ closed in 2 lines after Adams–Cardon had proved the hard half).
20. per-family circularity check: which side of RH does a census statement sit on.
21. judge thresholds against the EXACT model, not an expansion (a_c).
22. constant-transfer between families is a hypothesis, not a rule (b_c).

Infrastructure:

23. zsh heredoc separators execute — quote echo args.
24. numpy 2.x np.trapezoid.
25. mpmath mp.mpc needs (re,im) floats.
26. foreground sleep blocked — background monitors.
27. PARALLEL heredoc bash calls race on persisted cwd — Write scripts to absolute paths.
28. workflow straggler: session compaction mid-workflow kills the runner — read agent transcripts from wf_*/agent-*.jsonl to recover.
29. Odlyzko fetch: old dtc.umn.edu 301s; fetch the redirected www-users.cse.umn.edu URL directly.
30.–32. = renumbered duplicates of 16–18. [Full prose #30: NOTES.md:1260]

## §2. #33–#38 — verbatim from `NOTES.md`

33. **Summarising-hop transpositions** — "[three silent transpositions] all introduced at the
    SUMMARISING hop, all three in the block offered as the reconstruction check" (NOTES.md:1529–1534).
    Class: derived/reconstructed statements drift at the summary layer; quote the primary record.
34. **RH-side declaration** — "before launching a census, write down which side of RH the
    statement sits on; if 'consequence', state what the census calibrates instead"
    (NOTES.md:1534–1536; rule adopted from machine 3's standing practice).
35. **Fired-falsifier reporting order** — "a fired falsifier must be reported as fired BEFORE
    any reconciliation is banked" (NOTES.md:1673–1674; founding instance: 0.0720 falsifier,
    both models violated pre-registration).
36. **Quote outputs, not memory** — "quote derived signs from the output file, never
    reconstruct them" (NOTES.md:1618–1622; founding instance: κ signs first recorded flipped).
37. **Detector validity domain** — "the model birth detector 'real-zero-count < 4' is INVALID
    at κ₁≠0 sites — 4 real zeros can coexist with off-axis pairs, so the bisection stops
    early… Use locate/winding for model predictions wherever κ₁ is not ≈0" (NOTES.md:1701–1704).
38. **Index-based own-pair exclusion** — "value-based searchsorted pair-exclusion on ROUNDED
    (mid,d) pollutes the sum by ±1/d (Lehmer +53.05 — exactly the blown-up residual);
    mpf in f-string format spec raises TypeError — wrap float()" (NOTES.md:1804–1807).

## §3. #39–#43 — verbatim from `REPLY_TO_BEAST_3.md` §6 ("TRAP REGISTER ADDITIONS")

39. "locate-returned 'zeros' with |Im| ~ 1e−38…1e−50 are ALWAYS findroot noise on the
    real-axis Γ-shelf (|F| ~ 1e−6145 from |Γ(0.11 + i·4511)|²). Require |Im| > 1e−6.
    Cost us one false falsification before we caught it."
40. "detector 'w ≠ real ⇒ BIRTH' counts every well in a multi-well box. Retired; count only
    located zeros."
41. "smallest-|F| seeding is blinded by 6000-orders dynamic range. FIX (now our default
    instrument): the scale-free ratio **H = Xb²/(λ·Xₐ·X₋ₐ) − 1** — Γ-decay cancels,
    acceptance |H| < 1e−12, dimensionless."
42. "pre-register births with WELL SCOPE — name which well's pair."
43. "H must be seeded at ABSOLUTE z = m₀ + offset. Relative offsets silently evaluate ζ near
    s = ½ + 0.35i; signature: |H| ≈ 0.9965 everywhere, even in x. Cost one relaunch, no data
    lost."

## §4. #44–#51 — verbatim from `NOTES.md`

44. "when a compound regressor (q = q_ε1 + q_far) is used across a pool where one channel
    dominates in-pool but another dominates at the anchor site, extrapolation failures are
    channel misattributions, not physics — decompose before naming a turnover or a new
    regime" (NOTES.md:2195–2199).
45. "cross-instrument site refs must be value-anchored (MID ≥ 7 digits + d); a ±1 index slip
    mimics a birth/no-birth disagreement" (NOTES.md:2330–2332; founding instance: machine 2's
    W-site d off by 63% until the fix).
46. "A correction term that improves the residual at ONE favourable site is not an amendment:
    regress across the pool before adopting" (NOTES.md:2470–2473; founding instance:
    mirror-window term, helps W −0.0107→−0.0044, pool best-fit slope −0.535).
47. "'WIN = 50' is ambiguous across instruments: ORDINATE half-width (ours, ±50 in γ) vs
    ZERO COUNT (50 zeros/side ≈ ±43 at h=9023)" (NOTES.md:2473–2475).
48. mixed-provenance quotes — "our published quotes were MIXED-PROVENANCE… S2_windowed(WIN=50)
    (W) = our recorded quote EXACTLY; but k922/Lehmer quotes were FULL-table" (NOTES.md:2498–2503).
    Class: a table of numbers assembled across sessions can mix conventions silently; re-derive
    the whole column from one instrument before publishing.
49. "higher-order FD derivatives of large-magnitude logs are untrustworthy; use exact/Cauchy
    extraction" (NOTES.md:2532–2533). **Extended 2026-09-02 night (heat51/51b): the class
    includes mpmath's `mp.taylor` — a wrapper on Richardson-extrapolated `ctx.diffs`. Silent
    (no error estimate), precision-stable across dps sweeps, site-dependent, and chaotically
    input-sensitive (a 7e-10 shift in m₀ swung a₅ by 208× at Lehmer). Convicted machine 3's
    published Lehmer κ₅ (+17.2788 vs truth +18.406508). Only a per-site independent gate
    (the table identity) detects it.**
50. "pin normalization per coefficient" — "the two published κ₃/κ₄ conventions differ (plain
    vs j!) and neither letter stated its normalization" (NOTES.md:2539–2545).
51. hand-copied indices — "first run located telescope by hand-copied index 95248 → d=0.5906
    (wrong site; that index = pair's upper member). Caught by value sanity, fixed by
    value-anchor" (NOTES.md:2624–2628; instance #2).

## §5. #52–#54 — NEW, registered 2026-09-02 arbitration night (heat51/51b/52; all founding
instances disclosed in `machine1-kappa5-arbitration-mptaylor-conviction.md` and the scripts)

52. **A sanity check's reference is itself code and can be the bug.** Founding instance
    (heat51 P0): the truth array for mp.taylor on log(1+z) was mis-signed (coefficients of
    −log(1+z)); the check then reported "error 1.0" against CORRECT instrument output, and
    briefly impugned it. Rule: when a sanity check fails, verify the truth side by an
    independent closed form before believing either side. (#49-family, analysis layer.)
53. **Contour wiring must feed RAW values to the branch unwrap — never a pre-logged
    function.** Founding instance (heat51 P1 control): F already returned log(·) and was
    passed through log_unwrap again (log-of-log); the control "failed" at 78–3463× until
    rewired (heat51b P4: 3.97e-16). Signature: uniformly huge, radius-INSENSITIVE error.
54. **Pin each variable's convention at a data JOIN.** Founding instance (heat52 first pass):
    joined model-windowed q (site_setup B, WIN=50) against freshly computed full-table q —
    one site failed to join; the two conventions differ by up to ~0.2% in q (W: windowed
    0.248 vs full 0.2503). Rule: at any cross-source join, print a convention check
    (max |Δ| per key) before analysis. (#47/#48-family, join layer.)
